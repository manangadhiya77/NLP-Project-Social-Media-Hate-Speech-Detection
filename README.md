# NLP-Project-Social-Media-Hate-Speech-Detection

This project implements advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform a specific task. It leverages state-of-the-art methods and libraries to preprocess, analyze, and derive insights from textual data.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop an NLP pipeline that can handle various stages of text processing, including data cleaning, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. It demonstrates the application of machine learning or deep learning models to solve NLP-related problems.

## Features

- Comprehensive text preprocessing pipeline.
- Implementation of feature extraction techniques (TF-IDF, word embeddings, etc.).
- Model training and evaluation on custom or publicly available datasets.
- Visualization of results and metrics.
- Customizable for different NLP tasks.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following Python libraries:

- Python 3.8+
- NLTK
- spaCy
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (depending on the implementation)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install nltk spacy scikit-learn tensorflow numpy matplotlib pandas
```

## Dataset

The project is designed to work with textual datasets. You can use publicly available datasets (e.g., IMDB, Twitter, or custom datasets) for training and evaluation. Place your dataset in the `data/` directory.

Example datasets:

- [Kaggle Sentiment Analysis Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sentiment-analysis-dataset)
- [20 Newsgroups Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/real_world.html#newsgroups-dataset)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manangadhiya77/NLP-Project-Social-Media-Hate-Speech-Detection.git
   cd NLP_NLP_project_(Main) (1).ipynb
   ```

2. Prepare your dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook NLP_project_(Main).ipynb
   ```

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate results.

5. Trained models will be saved in the `models/` directory, and evaluation results will be saved in the `results/` directory.

## Results

The project provides detailed metrics and visualizations for evaluating the model's performance. These include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

| Metric           | Value           |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| Accuracy         |                 |
| Precision        |                 |
| Recall           |                 |
| F1-Score         |                 |

## Customization

- Modify the preprocessing steps to suit your dataset (e.g., tokenization, stemming, lemmatization).
- Experiment with different feature extraction techniques or embedding models (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT).
- Adjust hyperparameters for the model to optimize performance.
- Add custom visualization methods for deeper insights.
